However, when symptoms *do* occur, they can be quite varied and may not be directly linked to the liver.  Some common symptoms associated with fatty liver include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or lacking energy.\n",
            "* **Abdominal discomfort:**  This can range from mild discomfort to more noticeable pain in the upper right abdomen.\n",

The presence of these symptoms does *not* automatically mean you have fatty liver disease.  **If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it's essential to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes.**  They will likely perform blood tests and imaging studies (such as ultrasound or MRI) to determine if you have fatty liver disease and its severity.\n"
